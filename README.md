# leaflet-challenge
Received help from the AskBCS learning assistant for debugging the code for the legend.
NOTE: After getting help and having the code checked by the learning assistant, the code for the legend was still not working 100%, for some reason the colors were not showing up in the legend. 
There were no errors in the code as per the learning assistant.
Inspected the html and checked for errors in the console as well, there were no issues.

Referred to the leaflet website for help with using the pointToLayer option to create the markers:
https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/

Used this website for marker colors:
